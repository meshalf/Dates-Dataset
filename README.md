This repository contains a subset of the dataset used in the ongoing research project titled:
“A Machine Learning Approach for Classifying Date Fruit Varieties at the Rutab Stage.”

#Description:

The dataset includes images of date fruits collected at the Rutab stage — the semi-ripe phase characterized by partial softening and color change.
It is designed to support research in machine learning, computer vision, and agricultural automation, particularly for tasks such as fruit classification, maturity estimation, and quality assessment.

This released subset represents part of a larger dataset that is still being collected and curated as part of ongoing work.
